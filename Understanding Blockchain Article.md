## What is blockchain?
Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its application goes far beyond just digital currencies. Let's break it down:

# A Digital Ledger
Imagine a ledger, which is like a record-keeping book. Blockchain is a digital version of this ledger. It's used to record **transactions** or any **digital interaction** that needs to be recorded and verified as being secure and genuine.

## Blocks and Chains
The term "blockchain" comes from the way it stores transaction data — in **blocks** that are linked together to form a **chain**. Each block contains a number of transactions. Once a block’s storage capacity is filled, it is closed and linked to the previously filled block, creating a chain of data known as the “blockchain.”

## Decentralization
Unlike traditional ledgers, which are managed by a central authority (like a bank), a blockchain is **decentralized**. This means it's **distributed** across many computers around the world. No single person or organization has control over the entire chain.

## Transparency and Security
Each transaction on a blockchain is transparent and can be seen by anyone who has access to the system. Every transaction is encrypted and has a unique record that can’t be altered retroactively. This makes blockchain very secure against fraudulent activities.

## Consensus Mechanisms
For a transaction to be recorded on the blockchain, it needs to be verified by multiple participants in the network. This is done through consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. These mechanisms ensure that all parties agree on the validity of the transaction.
